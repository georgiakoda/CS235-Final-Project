This was my final project for Software Analysis & Design 2. 

You can create a "cavern" and use the creatures.csv file to fill it with a variety of creatures, each with unique attacks based on the class of Creature.

The "cavern" maintains a stack of the highest level creatures of each type.

Executing the main file will prompt the user to select some attacks to equip each creature with. This adds the attacks to the creatures attack queue. Attacks are defined as a struct within the Creature interface.

Attack stats will vary based on creature type, category, level, etc.
